     # ESP-NOW Protocol with ESP32

This project focuses on using the ESP-NOW protocol for wireless communication between ESP32 devices. ESP-NOW is a connectionless communication protocol developed by Espressif, allowing multiple devices to communicate with each other with minimal power consumption and low latency.

## Features

- **One-Way Communication**
- **Two-Way Communication**
- **Low Power Consumption**
- **Low Latency**

## Components

- ESP32 development boards
- Power supply
- Optional: Sensors/actuators for practical applications

## ESP-NOW Protocol Overview

ESP-NOW is an efficient and lightweight communication protocol designed for the ESP32 microcontroller. It enables devices to communicate with each other without the need for a traditional Wi-Fi network. The protocol is ideal for applications requiring low-power and low-latency communication.

### One-Way Communication

In one-way communication, one ESP32 device (the sender) transmits data to another ESP32 device (the receiver) without expecting any acknowledgment or response.

#### Applications

- Sensor data transmission from remote sensors to a central node.
- Simple command transmission to control devices.

#### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The sender and receiver are initialized with ESP-NOW.
2. **Data Transmission**: The sender transmits data to the receiver's MAC address.
3. **Data Reception**: The receiver listens for incoming data from the sender.

### Two-Way Communication

In two-way communication, two ESP32 devices communicate with each other, allowing both devices to send and receive data, and acknowledge the receipt of data.

#### Applications

- Bidirectional communication between devices for control and feedback.
- Peer-to-peer communication in mesh networks.

#### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Both devices are initialized with ESP-NOW.
2. **Data Exchange**: Each device can send data to and receive data from the other device.
3. **Acknowledgment**: Each device acknowledges the receipt of data, ensuring reliable communication.

## Advantages of ESP-NOW

- **Low Power Consumption**: Ideal for battery-powered devices.
- **Low Latency**: Quick data transmission suitable for real-time applications.
- **No Wi-Fi Network Required**: Devices communicate directly with each other.
- **Scalability**: Multiple devices can communicate simultaneously.

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**
    - Ensure each ESP32 device is properly powered.
    - Connect any necessary sensors or actuators to the ESP32 devices.

2. **Software Setup**
    - Install the necessary libraries and tools for ESP-NOW on the ESP32 devices.
    - Upload the appropriate code to each ESP32 device for either one-way or two-way communication.

## Usage

### One-Way Communication

1. **Sender**: Configure the sender device to transmit data to the receiver's MAC address.
2. **Receiver**: Configure the receiver device to listen for incoming data from the sender.
3. **Operation**: Power on both devices. The sender will transmit data, and the receiver will process the incoming data.

### Two-Way Communication

1. **Device A and B**: Configure both devices to send and receive data from each other's MAC addresses.
2. **Operation**: Power on both devices. Each device can send data to the other and will acknowledge receipt of incoming data.
